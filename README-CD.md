# Project 5

## Part 1 - Semantic Versioning

### Overview
We are using continuous deployment in this project to automate the tasks of pulling the image back
to the system after an update is pushed. We first create tags to indicate which image should be pulled.
Once the images are tagged, we are able to use webhooks to automatically send a message back to the 
system indicating that the image has been updated.This will also automatically pull the image back to the system.
