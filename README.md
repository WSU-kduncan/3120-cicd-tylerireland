# Project 4

## Part 1 - Dockerize it

### Overview
  The objective of this project is to create a container that will run a website with apache2. Containers contain libraries and files required to run a single service or software. They are similar to a virtual machine, but are much more lightweight and efficient. They can also be deployed are many machines.
  
### Run Project Locally
  WSL2 should be installed prior to installing Docker. Docker uses WSL2 so having it installed before will make the installation smoother. I already had WSL2 installed prior to this project. I installed both through their website and it was pretty simple.
